# Creational-Design-Patterns
Assignment : Creational Design Petterns in Java

This project demonstrates **five major Creational Design Patterns** implemented in Java.

## 1. Singleton Pattern
**Purpose:** Ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global point of access.  
**Use When:** You need a single shared resource, like a Logger or Configuration Manager.  


## 2. Factory Method Pattern
**Purpose:** Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
**Use When:** You have multiple related object types and want to delegate creation to a factory.  


## 3. Builder Pattern
**Purpose:** Separates object construction from its representation.  
**Use When:** You need to build complex objects step by step (e.g., computers or documents).  


## 4. Prototype Pattern
**Purpose:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object.  
**Use When:** Object creation is expensive or complex, and you want to duplicate it easily.  


## 5. Abstract Factory Pattern
**Purpose:** Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.  
**Use When:** You need to produce related UI components (e.g., light and dark themes) without specifying concrete classes.
